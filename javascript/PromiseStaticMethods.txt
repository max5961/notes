List the 6 Promise static methods:
.all, .allSettled, .race, .any, .resolve, .reject

Describe Promise.all
All or nothing.  Accepts an array of Promises, resolves when all resolve, rejects as soon as one rejects

Describe Promise.allSettled
Accepts an array of Promises, resolves when all settle regardless of being fulfilled or rejected.  Result is an array of Promise states

Describe Promise.race
Accepts an array of Promises, resolves when the first Promise settles.  Result is the 'result' or 'reason' of the first to settle.

Describe Promise.any
Accepts an array of Promises.  Ignores rejected Promises and resolves when the first Promise resolves.

In Promise.any, if all Promises reject, what kind of value is the 'reason' for the rejection.
AggregateError, a special Error object that stores all Promise errors in an array in its error property

Describe Promise.resolve
same as: const resolvedPromise = new Promise(resolve => resolve(5));

Describe Promise.reject
same as: const rejectedPromise = new Promise((_, reject) => reject(new Error(5))
