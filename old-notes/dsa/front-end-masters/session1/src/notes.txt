Big-O Complexity

Common Complexities:
    O(1) - constant
    O(logn) - logn
    O(n) - linear
    O(nlogn)
    O(n^2)
    O(2^n)
    O(n!)

Arrays:
    An array is a continuous, unbreaking memory space that contains a certain about of bytes
    Arrays are fixed size, continiguous memory chunks
    You cannot "grow" arrays
    There are no insertAt, push, or pop.  You can however, implement those methods yourself or use those built in methods
