Chapter 6 - Exit and Exit Status

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### The "exit" command
    - terminates a script
    - can also return a value, which is then available to scripts parent process
    - successful command returns a 0
    - unsuccessfull command returns a non-zero value that can usually be
    interpreted as an error code
    - functions within a script can also return an exit status
        - the last command executed in the function of a script determines the
        exit status

    - "exit nnn" may be used to deliver an nnn exit status to the shell
        - nnn must be an integer in the 0 - 255 range

    #!/bin/bash
    COMMAND_1
    ...
    COMMAND_LAST
    # will exit with the status of last command

    # exit $? or even just ommitting the exit is the same thing as the line
    # below
    exit

    - $? read the exit status of the last command executed.
    - this is bash's way of giving functions a "return value"
