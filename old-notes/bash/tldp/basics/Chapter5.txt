Chapter 5 - Quoting
https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/quoting.html
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- when referencing a variable its generally advisable to enclose its name in
double quotes
- this is to prevent the reinterpretation of special characters within the
quoted string except for $, `, and \
- keeping $ as a special character within double quotes permits referencing a
quoted variable

    # splits $List by whitespace in the for loop
    List="one two three"
    for a in $List
    do
        echo "$a"
    done
    # one # two # three

    # wrapping $List preserves the whitespace in the variable
    for a in "$List"
    do
        echo "$a"
    done
    # one two three

- since single quotes are "full quoting", the special meaning of $ is truned off
- therefore you cannot reference variables by enclosing them in single quotes
    a=5
    echo '$a'   # output is $a, not 5

- encapsulating ! within double quotes gives an error when used from the command
line, but this problem does not occur within a script

### Escaping
    \n: newline
    \r: return
    \t: tab
    \v: vertical tab
    \b: backspace
    \a: alert
    \": gives quote literal its literal meaning
    \$: gives the dollar sign its literal meaning
    \\: gives the backslash its literal meaning
